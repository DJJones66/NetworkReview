## LLM Instructions for Plugin Creation

Using the NetworkEyes plugin located at `PluginBuild/NetworkEyes` as a reference, create a new plugin called `NetworkReview` located at `PluginBuild/NetworkReview`.

The plugin should implement a rotating review display system that showcases customer testimonials in an engaging, professional format suitable for marketing and social proof purposes.

### Core Plugin Requirements

**Design Consistency**: Match the styling patterns used in existing BrainDrive plugins, including support for both light and dark themes. Use standard CSS with modern styling patterns.

**Self-Contained Logic**: Do not use React's useState or other hooks. The plugin must be fully modular and compatible with the BrainDrive plugin loader using React class components.

**Performance**: Ensure the plugin is optimized for performance and doesn't impact the overall BrainDrive application.

**Modularity**: The plugin should be completely self-contained and not depend on external services unless explicitly required.

**Layout and Sizing**: Use appropriate layout structure and dimensions to maintain UI consistency with other BrainDrive plugins.

### NetworkReview Specific Implementation Details

#### Review Data Structure
Create 5 fake reviews with the following structure:
```typescript
interface Review {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  designation: string;
  rating: number; // 1-5 stars
  text: string;
  avatar?: string; // placeholder or initials
}
```

#### Sample Review Data
Include realistic sample data such as:
1. **John Smith** (Client Designation) - 4/5 stars - Professional service review
2. **Sarah Johnson** (Customer) - 5/5 stars - Product quality review  
3. **David Chen** (Business Owner) - 4/5 stars - Support experience review
4. **Maria Rodriguez** (Manager) - 5/5 stars - Implementation success review
5. **Alex Thompson** (Developer) - 4/5 stars - Technical solution review

#### Visual Design Requirements
- **Card Layout**: Clean, modern card design with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- **Profile Section**: Avatar placeholder (colored circle with initials) and customer info
- **Rating Display**: Visual star rating system (filled/empty stars)
- **Review Text**: Readable typography with proper spacing
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fade or slide transitions between reviews
- **Color Scheme**: Professional colors that work in light/dark themes
- **Responsive**: Adapt to different container sizes

#### Animation and Timing
- **Auto-rotation**: Change review every 10 seconds
- **Smooth Transitions**: 0.5-1 second transition between reviews
- **Loop Behavior**: Seamlessly return to first review after the last one
- **Pause on Hover**: Optional - pause rotation when user hovers over the card
- **Visual Indicators**: Optional dots or progress indicator showing current review

### Critical Implementation Guidelines & Solutions

#### 1. TypeScript Configuration
**MANDATORY**: Configure TypeScript properly to avoid compilation issues:
- Set `"strict": false` in tsconfig.json
- Set `"noEmit": false` in tsconfig.json  
- Use `any` type for timer variables instead of `NodeJS.Timeout`
- Include proper lib arrays: `["dom", "dom.iterable", "es6"]`

#### 2. CSS and Styling Configuration
**CRITICAL**: Avoid TailwindCSS PostCSS configuration issues:
- **DO NOT** include TailwindCSS in dependencies or configuration
- Configure postcss.config.js to only include `autoprefixer`
- Use standard CSS classes with modern styling patterns
- Implement responsive design with CSS media queries
- Support dark mode with `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`

#### 3. React Component Architecture
**REQUIRED**: Use React class components for plugin compatibility:
- Extend `React.Component<{}, StateInterface>`
- Use `this.state` and `this.setState()` for state management
- Implement `componentDidMount()` and `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle methods
- Use class methods with arrow functions for proper `this` binding
- **NEVER** use functional components or hooks

#### 4. Timer and Async Operations Management
**IMPORTANT**: Handle timers and async operations properly:
- Use `any` type for timer variables: `private timer: any = null;`
- Always clear timers in `componentWillUnmount()` to prevent memory leaks
- Use `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` for timing control
- Handle async operations with proper error handling

#### 5. NetworkReview State Management
**SPECIFIC**: Implement proper state for review rotation:
```typescript
interface NetworkReviewState {
  currentReviewIndex: number;
  isTransitioning: boolean;
  reviews: Review[];
}
```

#### 6. Module Federation Configuration
**ESSENTIAL**: Configure webpack properly for BrainDrive integration:
- Ensure webpack.config.js exposes the main component correctly
- Use consistent naming between library name and exposed module
- Set unique port number: **3007** (avoid conflicts with existing plugins)
- Configure shared React dependencies properly

#### 7. Required File Structure
**MANDATORY**: Create the following modular file structure for easier debugging and feature enhancement:
```

  }
}
```

#### 9. Build Process Verification
**MANDATORY**: Ensure the build process works:
1. `npm install` - Install dependencies
2. `npm run build` - Build for production
3. Verify `dist/` directory contains `remoteEntry.js`
4. Test that no TypeScript or PostCSS errors occur

### Component Implementation Guidelines

#### Modular Component Architecture
- **ComponentNetworkReview.tsx**: Main container component managing state and timer
- **ReviewCard.tsx**: Reusable component for displaying individual reviews
- **StarRating.tsx**: Dedicated component for rendering star ratings
- **CustomerAvatar.tsx**: Component for customer avatar/initials display

#### State Management
- Use class-based state with proper TypeScript interfaces in main component
- Initialize state in constructor with review data from `reviewData.ts`
- Use `setState()` for updating current review index
- Handle state cleanup in `componentWillUnmount()`
- Pass data down to child components via props

#### Review Rotation Logic
- Implement rotation logic in `utils/reviewRotation.ts` for reusability
- Start timer in `componentDidMount()` of main component
- Increment review index every 10 seconds using utility functions
- Reset to 0 when reaching end of reviews array
- Clear timer in `componentWillUnmount()`

#### Styling Approach
- Write standard CSS with descriptive class names in separate files
- Use CSS custom properties for theming across components
- Implement responsive design with media queries
- Support both light and dark themes
- Follow BrainDrive design patterns
- Create smooth transitions between reviews using `animations.ts` helpers
- Scope styles to prevent conflicts between components

#### Error Handling
- Handle missing review data gracefully
- Provide fallback content if reviews fail to load
- Handle timer errors appropriately
- Log errors for debugging

#### Performance Considerations
- Minimize re-renders with proper state management
- Clean up resources in component unmount
- Optimize animations and transitions
