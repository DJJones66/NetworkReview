# Hooks Directory

This directory is reserved for future hook utilities that may be needed for the NetworkReview plugin.

## Purpose

While the current implementation uses React class components as required by the BrainDrive plugin system, this directory serves as a placeholder for potential utility functions that could support future enhancements.

## Potential Future Utilities

- Custom hook-like utilities for state management
- Animation coordination helpers
- Event handling utilities
- Performance optimization helpers

## Note

All utilities in this directory should be compatible with the class-based component architecture used in the plugin.
